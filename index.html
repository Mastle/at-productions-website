  (latest one) steps:
    - (current step) make the website production ready ->  it's almost finished -> add the finishing touches to both projects (you don't have more than two hours left in you to do that. Maybe it's an all night grind night this time. But you'll do it). and you'll relax to Japanese till you fall asleep!
    - This will require multiple attempts to fully unify and homogenize
    -> an exact timeline of your career and academic journey. This is the
    most crucial part for getting the go ahead from the consulate to move to
    Japan.
    -> Once you've been able to come up with the best version (most authentic +
    all gaps and inconsistencies are reasonably justified and addressed)
    -> You'll add that shit to the about section of this website
    -> but right now, you can just focus on developing the final bits of ATP and Joyful Speaking.
    -> Once this is all done, you'll make a habit of keeping them all regularly updated. This is how
    you'll keep your coding skills super sharp as you're mastering the Japanese way
    - (final step after deploying the relaunch) CHECK POSTPRODUCTION FOLDER TO KNOW WHICH BLOGPOSTS TO INCLUDE AT RELAUNCH

Biggest madafkin BREAKTHROUGH for this project(current stesp):

          
 These are absolutely the things I want this website to promote, after all these years it finally has multiple purposes and I fucking love it:
    - Developer Determination (a form of content that gives the developers in the middle of a project with certain tools that may not be the
       best, but they can still utilize it if it's used in a certain way or for certain applications. Another way that I could go about this is giving the spotlight to the tools that are the polar opposite of the most recent thing that has become popular)
    - Client Education (lack of knowledge is the biggest reason why clients don't get the best out of their projects, and I want to change that. This was the main reason I endured an unbelievable amount of pain as a developer. This oughtta be fixed)
    - Ethical Engineering (another concept that is woefully missing from our industry and even our lives these days. I've got a lot of work to do for this one as well)
 
 
    -->

<!-- 
DEADLINE: DEY 7

 steps:

 -> Before deployment:
  
  - Must host this on "Taqidev.github.io" (not mastle.github.io)
  - make blog list summary font size bigger on responsive
  - add more distance between the blog title and the blog obdy
  - Add your first blog post
  - Optimize, optimize, optimize! almost no image is optimized, and use Extensions and all the available tools to make sure you're following industry standards and fill the gaps
